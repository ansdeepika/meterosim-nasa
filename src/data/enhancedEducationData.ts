        title: 'Environmental Consequences and Recovery',
        content: 'Major impacts cause environmental devastation followed by long recovery periods. The Chicxulub impact triggered global wildfires, acid rain, ozone depletion, and nuclear winter effects that contributed to the extinction of 75% of Earth\'s species, including all non-avian dinosaurs. Ecosystem recovery from such events typically requires 5-10 million years.',

The 1908 Tunguska event flattened 2,000 square kilometers of Siberian forest but created no crater due to airburst. The 2013 Chelyabinsk event injured 1,500 people through glass damage and left meteorite fragments in Lake Chebarkul, demonstrating how even small impacts can cause significant damage in populated areas.',
